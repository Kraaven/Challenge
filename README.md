# The 1 Hour Challeneg

I wanted to test my ability to make games in the Unity game engine. The goal was th create a game in 1 hour in Unity.


## Note
- I made this game in 1 hour
- It was not completely functional after 1 hour, but after 2 minutes of tweaking after the 1 hour deadline, i was able to fix that bug.
- This game is a recreation of the the chrome dino game {no art assets}. 
- This game has a function jumping system, a functional enemy spawning system and a functional enemy collision and endgame screen

After the 1 hour:

- Fixed the endscreen bug in 2 minutes
- Added a score UI depended in surviving time
- Display Score on the endscreen.
